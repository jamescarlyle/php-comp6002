Forecasting future building operation states provides operators with comprehensive insights, allowing them to understand and optimize the factors influencing various aspects of building performance, including energy consumption. While conventional modeling tools such as EnergyPlus are widely employed to predict the behavior of buildings, they often struggle to capture the full complexity of real-world operational dynamics, as their outputs are greatly affected by the assumptions made during the modeling process and due to the stochasticity associated with real-world building operations. In this regard, this paper investigates the Physics-Informed Deep Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (PISTGNN) Ensemble, which integrates residual learning and physics constraints into an encoder-decoder structured Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN), to precisely estimate building operational dynamics 5 minutes in advance. The experimental results demonstrate that the Ensemble model achieved an average improvement of 44.7% in RMSE over the pure data-driven model across seasonal test sets, underscoring its robustness. Moreover, the model's predictions deviate by only 0.78% from the true values in real-world scenarios, highlighting its exceptional accuracy and reliability for practical applications. PINN integration enhances the model's capability to manage compounding errors in data-sparse regions, reducing model uncertainty.

Data-driven models often neglect the underlying physical principles, limiting generalization capabilities in water distribution systems (WDSs). This study presents a novel spatio-temporal graph physics-informed neural network (ST-GPINN) for water quality prediction in WDSs, integrating hydraulic simulations, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture dynamics and graph-based network connectivity while approximating partial differential equations (PDEs). ST-GPINN discretizes WDSs using virtual nodes to enhance spatial granularity, employs an Encoder-Processor-Decoder architecture for predictions. Validated on Network A (a small-scale network with 9 junctions and 11 pipes) and Network B (a real large-scale WDS with 920 junctions and 1032 pipes), ST-GPINN outperforms others, achieving a MAE of 0.0073 mg/L, RMSE of 0.0121 mg/L, and R2 of 88.91% in Network A, and a MAE of 0.008 mg/L, RMSE of 0.0098 mg/L, and R² of 98.91% in Network B. Its scalability and accuracy highlight ST-GPINN’s potential for water quality predictions.

The sustainable management of global groundwater resources is increasingly challenged by climatic uncertainty and escalating anthropogenic stress. Thus, there is a need for simulation tools that are more robust and flexible. This systematic review addresses the integration of two dominant modeling paradigms: the physically grounded Modular Finite-Difference Flow (MODFLOW) model and the data-agile Artificial Neural Network (ANN). While the MODFLOW model provides deep process-based understanding, it is often limited by extensive data requirements and computational intensity. In contrast, an ANN offers remarkable predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, particularly in complex, non-linear systems, but traditionally lacks physical interpretability. This review synthesizes existing research to present a functional classification framework for MODFLOW–ANN integration, providing a systematic analysis of the literature within this structure. Our analysis of the literature, sourced from Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar reveals a clear trend of the strategic integration of these models, representing a new trend in hydrogeological simulation. The literature reveals a classification framework that categorizes the primary integration strategies into three distinct approaches: (1) training an ANN on MODFLOW model outputs to create computationally efficient surrogate models; (2) using an ANN to estimate physical parameters for improved MODFLOW model calibration; and (3) applying ANNs as post-processors to correct systematic errors in MODFLOW model simulations. Our analysis reveals that these hybrid methods consistently outperform standalone approaches by leveraging ANNs for computational acceleration through surrogate modeling, for enhanced model calibration via intelligent parameter estimation, and for improved accuracy through systematic error correction.

Neural networks excel in various machine learning applications; however, they lack the physical interpretability and constraints crucial for numerous scientific and engineering problems. This limitation hinders their ability to accurately capture and predict complex physical systems’ behavior, potentially yielding inaccurate or unreliable results. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a class of machine learning models that integrate the power of neural networks with the physical laws governing natural phenomena. PINNs provide an effective tool for solving intricate physical problems, ranging from fluid dynamics to materials science, by incorporating physical constraints into the neural network architecture. PINNs can substantially enhance the accuracy and efficiency of model predictions, even in data-limited situations. This work offers insight into recent developments in the PINN field, including their mathematical formulation and training algorithms, and emphasizes their application in solving transient unconfined groundwater flow. In this context, the phreatic surface acts as a spatiotemporally varying boundary condition, and properly accounting for its position is vital for precise predictions of unconfined groundwater flow and related environmental and engineering applications. The study’s objective is to develop a reliable model for estimating the phreatic surface and the spatiotemporal distribution of piezometric heads in a vertical cross-section of an unconfined aquifer. Two cases are examined: the first involves a homogeneous and isotropic aquifer, while the second comprises a mildly heterogeneous and anisotropic one. The challenges and opportunities arising from this emerging research area are also explored, and essential directions for future research are underscored.

This thesis explores the integration of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly deep
learning, in enhancing groundwater prediction models. The primary focus is on developing new
surrogate models that leverage deep neural networks for simulating groundwater flow, bridging
the gap between traditional hydrological methods and contemporary data science approaches.
The research journey begins with the application of synthetic data and computer vision techniques and progressively advances towards handling sparse data and real-world scenarios. The

models for groundwater prediction. These models include convolutional encoder-decoder networks (Attention U-Net and U-Net integrated with Vision Transformer) for accurate steadystate response prediction, the DeepONet framework for generalized groundwater flow modeling
under data-sparse scenarios, and finally spatial-temporal graph neural networks for long-term
forecasting of groundwater levels. The research demonstrates the ability of these models to handle complex hydrological systems, predict accurately under varying conditions, and efficiently
process both high-dimensional inputs and sparse data.
Overall, this thesis contributes to the field of hydrology by establishing advanced machine
learning models as viable alternatives for predictive groundwater level modeling, particularly
noted for their accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability to diverse scenarios. The
findings pave the way for future research, focusing on applying these models to larger and more
complex datasets for practical use in groundwater management and decision-making

Developing accurate soft computing methods for groundwater level (GWL) forecasting is essential for enhancing the planning and management of water resources. Over the past two decades, significant progress has been made in GWL prediction using machine learning (ML) models. Several review articles have been published, reporting the advances in this field up to 2018. However, the existing review articles do not cover several aspects of GWL simulations using ML, which are significant for scientists and practitioners working in hydrology and water resource management. The current review article aims to provide a clear understanding of the state-of-the-art ML models implemented for GWL modeling and the milestones achieved in this domain. The review includes all of the types of ML models employed for GWL modeling from 2008 to 2020 (138 articles) and summarizes the details of the reviewed papers, including the types of models, data span, time scale, input and output parameters, performance criteria used, and the best models identified. Furthermore, recommendations for possible future research directions to improve the accuracy of GWL prediction models and enhance the related knowledge are outlined.
