# First Section

## A Subsection Sample

Please note that the first paragraph of a section or subsection is not
indented. The first paragraph that follows a table, figure, equation
etc. does not need an indent, either.

Subsequent paragraphs, however, are indented.

### Sample Heading (Third Level)

Only two levels of headings should be numbered. Lower level headings
remain unnumbered; they are formatted as run-in headings.

#### Sample Heading (Fourth Level)

The contribution should contain no more than four levels of headings.
Table [1](#tab1){reference-type="ref" reference="tab1"} gives a summary
of all heading levels.

::: {#tab1}
  Heading level       Example                                    Font size and style
  ------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------------------
  Title (centered)    **Lecture Notes**                          14 point, bold
  1st-level heading   **1 Introduction**                         12 point, bold
  2nd-level heading   **2.1 Printing Area**                      10 point, bold
  3rd-level heading   **Run-in Heading in Bold.** Text follows   10 point, bold
  4th-level heading   *Lowest Level Heading.* Text follows       10 point, italic

  : Table captions should be placed above the tables.
:::

Displayed equations are centered and set on a separate line.
$$x + y = z$$ Please try to avoid rasterized images for line-art
diagrams and schemas. Whenever possible, use vector graphics instead
(see Fig. [1](#fig1){reference-type="ref" reference="fig1"}).

![A figure caption is always placed below the illustration. Please note
that short captions are centered, while long ones are justified by the
macro package automatically.](fig1.eps){#fig1 width="\\textwidth"}

::: theorem
This is a sample theorem. The run-in heading is set in bold, while the
following text appears in italics. Definitions, lemmas, propositions,
and corollaries are styled the same way.
:::

::: proof
*Proof.* Proofs, examples, and remarks have the initial word in italics,
while the following text appears in normal font. ◻
:::

For citations of references, we prefer the use of square brackets and
consecutive numbers. Citations using labels or the author/year
convention are also acceptable. The following bibliography provides a
sample reference list with entries for journal articles [@ref_article1],
an LNCS chapter [@ref_lncs1], a book [@ref_book1], proceedings without
editors [@ref_proc1], and a homepage [@ref_url1]. Multiple citations are
grouped [@ref_article1; @ref_lncs1; @ref_book1],
[@ref_article1; @ref_book1; @ref_proc1; @ref_url1].

::: credits
### 

A bold run-in heading in small font size at the end of the paper is used
for general acknowledgments, for example: This study was funded by X
(grant number Y).

### 

It is now necessary to declare any competing interests or to
specifically state that the authors have no competing interests. Please
place the statement with a bold run-in heading in small font size
beneath the (optional) acknowledgments[^1], for example: The authors
have no competing interests to declare that are relevant to the content
of this article. Or: Author A has received research grants from Company
W. Author B has received a speaker honorarium from Company X and owns
stock in Company Y. Author C is a member of committee Z.
